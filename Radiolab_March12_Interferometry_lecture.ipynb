Thetas in the middle stay the same size. You're seeing the circular outline of the sphere, and a dot shows up at a position that is a sine of the angle from the center.

It is oscillating more quickly in the u direction, so the sine wave is pointing mostly in the u direction, so u is dominating over v. To do a Fourier Transform, try out all the different u's and v's, and take the picture of the sky, and integrate over all those sine waves, and you have the sky integrated over 2D Fourier components. A sine wave in 1D $\\rightarrow$ 2D sine wave. We like Gaussians in 1 Dimensional Fourier transforms, because it is the same thing. In 2D a Fourier transform of a Gaussian is still a Gaussian. A top hat function is a cylinder. A Fourier transform of a top hat is a sinc function. Fourier transform of a cylinder is a sink that is rotated in the second dimension -- a Bessel function of the first kind. So 2 Dimensional Fourier Transforms are mostly the same, except sine waves have an x and y component, our top hats are cylinders, and our sincs are Bessel functions.\n",

So your interferometer is measuring a Fourier transform of the sky. The interferometer is taking a Fourier transform for you."
